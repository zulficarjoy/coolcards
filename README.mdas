# Mini Blog Application

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example`.
3. Add your database credentials and API keys to the `.env` file.
4. Run `docker-compose up --build` to start the application.
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`.

## CI/CD Setup

- The application uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- On every push to the `main` branch, the application is built and deployed to the server.

## Security

- Database credentials and API keys are stored in environment variables.
- Ensure `.env` is not committed to the repository.
- API requests must include a valid API key in the `API_KEY` header.
